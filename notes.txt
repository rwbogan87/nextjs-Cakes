*server-side rendering
preparing page content that is pre-rendered on server, and the server handles the request (no waiting in certain scenarios)
standard NextJs apps are always pre-rendered by default, out of the box (ready for search engine optimizations, better initial load)

server-side and client-side data fetching is blended to create finished, rendered page

*file-based routing
special pages folder, structure defines routes automatically; less code, less work, more concise
